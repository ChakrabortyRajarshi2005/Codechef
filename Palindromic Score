Palindromic Score
Alice has three types of characters: 
A
A, 
B
B and 
C
C. She is given exactly 
X
X copies of 
A
A, 
Y
Y copies of 
B
B, and 
Z
Z copies of 
C
C. Alice must use all these characters to form a string. She is free to arrange the characters in any order of her choosing.

After Alice forms her string, Bob makes a move. Bob will choose one character type from { 
A
A, 
B
B, 
C
C } and delete all its occurrences from the string.

Alice’s final score is defined as the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of the string after Bob’s deletion. Both players play optimally:

Alice’s goal is to arrange characters to maximize her final score.
Bob’s goal is to choose a character to delete such that Alice’s score is minimized.
Determine the maximum achievable score that Alice can obtain through her optimal arrangement of characters.

A palindromic 
†
†
 subsequence is a subsequence which reads the same from left to right and right to left.

†
†
  A string 
T
T is called a subsequence of another string 
S
S if 
T
T can be derived from 
S
S by deleting zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space‐separated integers 
X
X, 
Y
Y, and 
Z
Z — the copies of 
A
A, 
B
B, and 
C
C respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer — the maximum achievable score that Alice can obtain through her optimal arrangement of characters.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : Alice makes the string 
A
A
A
AAA. Bob removes all occurrences of 
A
A. Thus, Alice is left with only the empty string.

Test Case 2 : Alice makes the string 
B
B
B
A
A
A
A
BBBAAAA. Bob removes all occurences of 
A
A. Thus, Alice is left with 
B
B
B
BBB, which is a palindrome itself of size 
3
3.
