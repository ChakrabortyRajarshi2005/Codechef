Attack on Kingdom
Nightking wants to attack the kingdom and he really likes cold days. However, he doesn’t want to attack the kingdom on the coldest day, because it is obvious.

Instead, he will attack the second coldest day. Given an array 
A
A of 
N
N distinct integers where 
A
i
A 
i
​
  represents the temperature forecast of the 
i
i-th day, You need to find the temperature of the day of the attack.

Input Format
First-line will contain 
T
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of every test case contains an integer 
N
N - the number of days
The second line of every test case contains 
N
N integers -

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line - the answer to the 
i
i-th test case.

Explanation:
Test Case 
1
1: There are only 
2
2 days, so the night king will attack the day with a higher temperature.
Test Case 
3
3: Out of the 
5
5 possible days, Night King will attack the day with the 2nd lowest temperature, therefore 
21
21 will be the answer.
