Critical points in a Linked List
Given the head of a linked list, Find the number of critical points. (The starting and end are not considered critical points).

Local minima or maxima are called critical points.

A Node is called a local minima if both next and previous elements are greater than the current element.

A Node is called a local maxima if both next and previous elements are smaller than the current element.

1 2 3 3 3 5 1 3
2 
Explanation:
1 is a minima and 5 is a maxima hence there are 2 critical points

Sample 2:

3
Explanation:
3rd node, 5th node and 6th node are the critical nodes, hence the answer is 3
// Node is defined as:
// class Node{
//     int val;
//     Node next;
//     Node(int x){
//     	val = x; next = null;
//     }
// }
class Solution{
    static int solve(Node root){
        if(root==null||root.next==null||root.next.next==null)
           return 0; 
        int count = 0;
        Node prev = root;
        Node curr = root.next;
        Node future = root.next.next;
        while(curr.next!=null){
            if(curr.val>prev.val && curr.val>future.val){
                count++;
            }
            else if(curr.val<prev.val && curr.val<future.val){
                count++;
            }
            prev = curr;
            curr = future;
            future = future.next;
        }
        return count;
    }
        
}
