Card Game
There is a set of N.
N cards where each card is numbered 1.
1 to N.


Chef throws a card numbered X.
Find the number of ways, Chefina can chose a card from the remaining deck such that, the sum of chosen card and 
X where X is even.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
N
N and 
X
X — the number of cards and the card thrown by Chef.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of ways, Chefina can chose a card from the remaining deck such that, the sum of chosen card and 
X
X is even.

Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: Chefina can only chose card numbered 
3
3 such that the sum is 
3
+
1
=
4
3+1=4, which is even.

Test case 
2
2: There are two cards and Chef throws card numbered 
2
2. Thus, Chefina cannot chose any card such that sum is even.

Test case 
3
3: Chefina can only chose card numbered 
2
2 such that the sum is 
4
+
2
=
6
4+2=6, which is even.
